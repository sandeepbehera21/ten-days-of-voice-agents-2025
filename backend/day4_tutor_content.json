They allow you to label data with a descriptive name, making your programs more understandable to the reader and yourself. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can store information to use later.",

A 'while' loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. They save you from writing the same code over and over again.",

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.",
