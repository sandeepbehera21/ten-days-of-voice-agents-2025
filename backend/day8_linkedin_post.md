**Headline:** 🎲 Building a Voice Game Master with Murf Falcon & LiveKit

For Day 8 of the **Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge**, I built an interactive D&D-style Voice Game Master!

This agent isn't just a storyteller—it's a full game engine.
✅ **Immersive Narration:** Uses **Murf Falcon** (the fastest TTS API) for real-time, dramatic descriptions.
✅ **World State:** Tracks inventory, health, and location in a JSON model.
✅ **Game Mechanics:** Rolls dice (d20) for risky actions like combat or stealth.
✅ **Save & Resume:** Implemented a system to save progress to a file and load it later!

It was a fun challenge to combine structured game logic with the fluidity of an LLM.
